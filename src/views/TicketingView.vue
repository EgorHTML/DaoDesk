        <p class="paragraph">
            DaoDesk’s ticketing system is designed to make customer support more efficient and manageable. When a
            customer
            submits a query, it’s logged as a ticket, which support agents can manually classify, prioritize, and assign
            based on the nature of the issue. This flexible approach allows teams to take control of how tickets are
            handled, ensuring the right attention is given to each case.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            DaoDesk offers easy tracking and ticket management features, so agents can monitor the progress of every
            ticket
            in real-time. With clear organization and simple tools, support teams can efficiently handle customer
            requests
            and ensure nothing is missed.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            The system allows for a streamlined process, helping agents stay on top of their workload and respond
            effectively. The result? Better organization, faster resolutions, and happier customers.
